<h1>Python-Experiments</h1>
This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, <i>Foundations of Data Science</i> at Mississippi State University.

____________

<h2>Plan</h2>
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a <a href="https://jupyter.org/ ">Jupyter</a> notebook will interact with the file.
<h2>About Me</h2>
I am Ashley Sumner, and I work as a contract and grant specialist in the Bagley College of Engineering. <b>Data Science</b> is becoming one of my passions.
My data science competencies include:
<ul>
  <li>Absolutely nothing yet.</li>
  <li>A lot of determination.</li>
  <li>Long nights.</li>
  <li>An affinity for solving complex problems.</li>
</ul>
In order to test the inclusion of a photograph, I've included a photo of me in peak form at the tender age of six:
