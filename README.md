<h1>Python-Experiments</h1>
This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University.
<h3>Plan</h3>
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [link]Jupyter <a href="https://jupyter.org/ ">link</a> notebook will interact with the file.
